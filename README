Database Simulator v1.0

goals:
-maintain index of citizens, organized by social security number, and containing other data
-read from database file into index strucutre on program start
-write to database file on program end, or after structure has been modified
features:
-insert citizen along with data
-update citizen's information
-display information about a citizen, provided their social security number
-display information for all citizens

Citizen structure (in database, not actually in program):
-char[10] for the social security number (*IMPORTANT*)
-char[32] for their name
-char[16] for their home city
-char[2] for ther home state
-unsigned int for their Date Of Birth, in MMDDYYYY format

CitizenIndex structure
-char[10] for social security number
-unsigned int "index" for the citizen's index in the database file

Citizens class:
-CitizenIndex[] array
-add method that checks for overflows and if so recreates the Array
-update method that does bounds-checking, accepts index or social security (overloaded)
-display method 
-compress method that compresses and removes empty records [to be done next project]
-delete method [to be done next project]

Array methods:

Search(social security number)
	Simple linear search

Init(ifstream database)
	load the whole file
	series of Add functions
	
Add(input data, ofstream database)
	if there is room in the array:
		creates CitizenIndex()
		append the structure to the database file
		populate structure in file with data
		find index in the file, set key to the result
		store in internal CitizenIndices array	
	else
		make a larger array (by 10)
		copy and paste existing elements
		redo function (this time there will be room, so it can do the first conditional)

Update(social security, fstream database)
	display menu asking user which property they want to Update
	search index with social security number
	get index, locate structure in file 
	edit database
	
Display(social security number)
	search index with social security number
	get index, locate structure in file
	display structure
	
DisplayAll()
	just display the whole file

Main application:
Array containing CitizenIndices
read 
set of instructions in a command/loop interface
